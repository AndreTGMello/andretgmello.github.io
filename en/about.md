Hi, I'm André Mello and research and coding are my passions!

I'm located in [São Paulo](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/feb/10/sao-paulo-brazil-crime-writer-joe-thomas), [Brazil](https://images7.memedroid.com/images/UPLOADED836/5a62a624e434d.jpeg).

I consider myself a generalist, although I've leaned on Artificial Intelligence topics for the most of my academic years. I got my bachelor's degree in [Information Systems](http://www.each.usp.br/si/) at the [University of São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/). More specifically, at the [School of Arts, Sciences and Humanities](http://www5.each.usp.br/). I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in [Computer Science](https://www.ime.usp.br/dcc/pos) at USP's [Institute of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.ime.usp.br/).
This is my academic CV: [Lattes CV](http://lattes.cnpq.br/1005222224619536).

My main areas of interest are [Machine Learning](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html) and [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.fast.ai/), as well as [Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/about/) and [Free/Libre Open Source Software](https://opensource.com/article/17/11/open-source-or-free-software).

My hobbies are [calisthenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calisthenics), a bit of [casual](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322330/Dont_Starve_Together/) [gaming](https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/) and [watching](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32182/Mob_Psycho_100) [some](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34599/Made_in_Abyss) [animations](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37991/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken_Part_5__Ougon_no_Kaze).

The latest project that I'm proud to have worked on in one of my master's classes is the
[MsFLOSS](https://gitlab.com/flusp/msfloss/msfloss/wikis/home). It is a system built for tracking relevant information on FLOSS projects. It's composed of various microservices. Each of which can gather data from different sources (GitHub, Issue Trackers, Mailing Lists, etc) and generate interesting visualizations and insights about a given project.

Want to contact me? Check my social media at the page's footer and feel free to drop me a message in any one of them or even send me an email! I'll be happy to get in touch. :)

Hi! My name is André Mello and research and coding are my passion!

I'm located in [São Paulo](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/feb/10/sao-paulo-brazil-crime-writer-joe-thomas), Brazil.

I consider myself a generalist, although I've leaned on Artificial Intelligence areas for the most of my academic years. I got my bachelor's degree in Information Systems at the [University of São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/), more specifically at the [School of Arts, Sciences and Humanities](http://www5.each.usp.br/). I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science at USP's Institute of Mathematics and Statistics.
This is my academic CV: [Lattes CV](http://lattes.cnpq.br/1005222224619536).

My main interests are
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- Research Software Engineering
- Free/Libre Open Source Software

## Projects

- [MsFLOSS](https://gitlab.com/flusp/msfloss/msfloss/wikis/home) is a system built for tracking relevant information on FLOSS projects. It's composed of various microservices. Each of which can gather data from different sources (GitHub, Issue Trackers, Mailing Lists, etc) and generate interesting visualizations and insights about a given project.

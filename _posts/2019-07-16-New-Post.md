So this is my first take ever on creating a web page.

I followed [this](https://forestry.io/blog/creating-a-multilingual-blog-with-jekyll/) tutorial by the folks at Forestry.

However their footer overites the beautiful footer created by the minimal theme. I headed over to their github page to grab the default footer but I could not get it to display the footer as intended.

It was only after checking out [some more resources](https://cyberloginit.com/2018/05/05/github-pages-jekyll-minima-customize-footer.html) that I get how to set it properly. I wonder why the minima `footer.html` does not use the `footer-col-1`, `footer-col-2`, `footer-col-3`.

It's been very useful, despite some minor issues that got me confused.
